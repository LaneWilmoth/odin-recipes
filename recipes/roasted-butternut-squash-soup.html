    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large butternut squash (about 3 pounds), halved vertically* and seeds removed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped shallot (about 1 large shallot bulb)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, pressed or minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon maple syrup</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>3 to 4 cups (24 to 32 ounces) vegetable broth, as needed</li>
        <li> to 2 tablespoons butter, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. 
            Place the butternut squash on the pan and drizzle each half with just enough olive oil to lightly 
            coat the squash on the inside (about ½ teaspoon each). Rub the oil over the inside of the squash 
            and sprinkle it with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Turn the squash face down and roast until it is tender and completely cooked through, about 40 to 50 minutes 
            (don&apos;t worry if the skin or flesh browns—that&apos;s good for flavor). Set the squash aside until it&apos;s cool enough 
            to handle, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>eanwhile, in a large soup pot, warm 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat until shimmering (if your blender 
            has a soup preset, use a medium skillet to minimize dishes.) Add the chopped shallot and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, 
            stirring often, until the shallot has softened and is starting to turn golden on the edges, about 3 to 4 minutes. 
            Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute, stirring frequently. Transfer the contents to your stand 
            blender (see notes on how to use an immersion blender instead).</li>
        <li>Use a large spoon to scoop the butternut squash flesh into your blender. Discard the tough skin. Add the maple syrup, 
            nutmeg and a few twists of freshly ground black pepper to the blender. Pour in 3 cups vegetable broth, being careful 
            not to fill the container past the maximum fill line (you can work in batches if necessary, and stir in any remaining 
            broth later).</li>
        <li>Securely fasten the lid. Blend on high (or select the soup preset, if available), being careful to avoid hot steam 
            escaping from the lid. Stop once your soup is ultra creamy and warmed through.</li>
        <li>If you would like to thin out your soup a bit more, stir in the remaining cup of broth. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons butter or 
            olive oil, to taste, and blend well. Taste and stir in more salt and pepper, if necessary.</li>
        <li>If your soup is piping hot from the blending process, you can pour it into serving bowls. If not, pour it back into your 
            soup pot and warm the soup over medium heat, stirring often, until it&apos;s nice and steamy. I like to top individual bowls 
            with some extra black pepper.</li>
