    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 lbs sirloin or ribeye steak</li>
        <li>1/3 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>12 ounces fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk or heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional toppings: balsamic glaze, blue cheese, fresh chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season both sides of the steak with salt and pepper and place in a ziplock 
            or reusable storage bag with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil and marinate 
            in the fridge for 30 minutes, or overnight</li>
        <li>While the steak is marinating, cook the pasta according to the package directions.
             Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil then add the pasta and cook until al dente. 
             Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water then drain the pasta from the rest of the water and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet, like a cast iron skillet, over medium high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade, shaking 
            off any excess. Sear the steak for 4 minutes on each side or until it reaches your desired doneness. I like to remove 
            the steak when it reaches an internal temp of 135°F for medium-rare steak (target temp 145°F). Rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the steak is resting, melt the butter in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes, 
            until fragrant. Add the flour to the butter and stir well to create a paste (a roux). Cook the roux for 2-3 minutes to ensure the 
            flour is fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Slowly whisk in the milk then add the salt and pepper. Continue to stir and simmer for about 5 minutes, until thickened. Add the 
            parmesan cheese and stir until melted and combined.</li>
        <li>Toss the cooked pasta with the alfredo sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, pour in the reserved pasta water a few tablespoons at 
            a time to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Slice the steak into thin pieces. Divide the pasta into bowl and top with steak slices.  Drizzle with balsamic glaze and garnish 
            with gorgonzola cheese and fresh parsley if desired.</li>
        <li>Please Enjoy!</li>

    <H2>Exper Tips for a Perfect Steak Alfredo</H2>
        <ul>
            <li>Choosing the right cut of steak is important. Opt for well-marbled cuts like sirloin or ribeye steak for enhanced flavor and tenderness.</li>
            <li>Aim for medium-rare to medium doneness to maintain juiciness. Use a meat thermometer for precision.</li>
            <li>If the sauce is too thick, incorporate a splash of reserved pasta water to adjust.</li>
            <li>Freshly grated Parmesan melts more seamlessly into the sauce compared to pre-shredded varieties.</li>
